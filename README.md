# Hello, there! I'm Brandon Juarez
Welcome to my personal Git repository. Here, you can find projects that summarize my experience in design and development across different languages and platforms.

## Projects. 
They are generally classified by the type of platform on which they are developed, as well as their implementation. However, they all reflect my coding skills across different languages.
### HDL and FPGA.
Design and synthesis of digital hardware using Verilog and/or VHDL, and its implementation on FPGA-based boards.
    1. Single-Cycle RISC-V Microprocessor
    2. GPIO Interface for Single-Cycle RISC-V Microprocessor
    3. DDS
#### Microcontrollers
Coding projects in C for PIC18F4550 microcontrollers.
    1. Generic Monitoring System
    2. Current Monitoring
    3. Weighing Belt
#### DSP
Coding projects in C and Assembly for DSK6713 boards with TMS320C6713 DSP.
    1. FIR Filters
    2. Equalizer
    3. FFT Coding
    4. FFT Implementation
    5. Adaptive Filter Coding
    6. Sine Wave DDS
    7. Multi-Sine Wave DDS
#### Programs and scripts
Source code for various programs or scripts
## Papers
Information about the technology dissemination articles I have written and published in journals or conference proceedings.
  * Digital Processing and Pattern Recognition of EMG Signals on FPGA
  * Analysis of Digital Filtering Algorithms in Embedded Hardware and Software
  * Analysis and Comparison of Digital Filtering Algorithms on DSP and FPGA
