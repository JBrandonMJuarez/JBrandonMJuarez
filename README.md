# Hello, there! I'm Brandon Juarez
Welcome to my personal GitHub. Here, you can find some projects that summarize my experience in design and development across different languages and platforms.

## Projects. 
They are generally classified by the type of platform on which they are developed, as well as their implementation. However, they all reflect my coding skills across different languages.
### HDL and FPGA.
Design and synthesis of digital hardware using Verilog and/or VHDL, and its implementation on FPGA-based boards.
